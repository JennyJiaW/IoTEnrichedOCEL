# From Conventional to IoT-Enhanced: Simulated Object-Centric Event Logs for Real-Life Logistics Processes

This is the repository for the paper: From Conventional to IoT-Enhanced: Simulated Object-Centric Event Logs for Real-Life Logistics Processes. In this work, we provide two simulated Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs) generated by the CPN tool for capturing real-life process executions in the logistics domain. The first OCEL captures the conventional cargo pickup process which starts from a customer lodging a pickup plan,
