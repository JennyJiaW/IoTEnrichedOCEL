# From Conventional to IoT-Enhanced: Simulated Object-Centric Event Logs for Real-Life Logistics Processes

This is the repository for the paper: From Conventional to IoT-Enhanced: Simulated Object-Centric Event Logs for Real-Life Logistics Processes. In this paper, we provide two simulated Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs) generated by the CPN tool for real-life logistics processes.
