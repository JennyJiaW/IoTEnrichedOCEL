# From Conventional to IoT-Enhanced: Simulated Object-Centric Event Logs for Real-Life Logistics Processes

This is the repository for the paper: From Conventional to IoT-Enhanced: Simulated Object-Centric Event Logs for Real-Life Logistics Processes. In this paper, we present two OCEL 2.0 logs, simulated using the CPN tool, which captures the cargo pickup process in one of the major ports in China. The first log represents the traditional cargo pickup process, encompassing multiple object types such as cargo, pickup plans, trucks, and silos. It also captures their static and dynamic relationships and their relationships with events. The second log builds upon the first by integrating IoT data, capturing the relationships between IoT objects and business objects, as well as between IoT objects and process events. This log details the intricate interactions between IoT devices and business processes.
